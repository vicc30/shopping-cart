# PROJECT: SHOPPING CART

This project is part of the [Odin Project JS Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). This is my solution for the Shopping Cart project

## Assignment

### Instructions

- [x] Create a new project with create-react-app.
- [x] Think about the component and the folder structure.
- [x] You should have at least have two pages.
- [x] On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
- [x] Build individual card items for each of your products.
- [x] Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
- [x] Style your application.

## Technologies and Scripts

This project uses `yarn`. In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
