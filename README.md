# PROJECT: SHOPPING CART

This project is part of the [Odin Project JS Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). This is my solution for the Shopping Cart project

## Assignment

### Instructions

- [x] Create a new project with create-react-app.
- [ ] Think about the component and the folder structure.
- [ ] You should have at least have two pages.
- [ ] On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
- [ ] Build individual card items for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items he or she wants to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
- [ ] Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
- [ ] Style your application.

## Technologies and Scripts
